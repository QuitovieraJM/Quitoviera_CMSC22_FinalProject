# VirtualPiano
A simple virtual piano, with limited keys, that has a screen that shows the output when the keys are clicked.

*The Music_Note folder is for the music note of the piano key. 

1.Design Patterns that I used are:
   >singleton for creational since the class in my program has only one instance.
   >Facade for structural because I have a single class that represents an entire subsystem.
   >Command for behavioral since each key has a specific music note to play.
 
2. TDD is hard to do for GUI from these articles/sites: https://www.jrebel.com/blog/when-to-use-test-driven-development and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/362671/does-tdd-apply-well-when-developing-an-ui. 
    So what I did is the trial and error way of testing. Make the code > test if it works as i expected > if not then make the test pass.
    
3. Best Java practices that I applied are naming, spacing, indention, the length of the java source file, with exceptions, declarations, added comments and javadocs.

That's it.
